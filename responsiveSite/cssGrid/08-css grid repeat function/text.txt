Where we have four columns so how I could normally do that is something like great template columns one FR four times and that give us I forgot 4 there we go that he was 4 column each 20 pixels space apart. what I can do that I just type the repeat function and then repeat function take to think first how many times you want to repeat it 1fr and what you would like to repeat.
