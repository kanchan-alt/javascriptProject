 - 4 > 3
   // -4 is indeed less than 3, so the expression is false.
    console.log(-4 > 3);//false

- 4 >= 3
// -4 is indeed less than equal than  3, so the expression is false.
    console.log(-4 >= 3);//false

- 4 < 3
// -4 is indeed less than  than  3, so the expression is true.
console.log(-4 < 3);//true

- 4 <= 3
// -4 is indeed less than equal than  3, so the expression is true.
console.log(-4 <= 3);//true

- 4 == 4
// they are different numbers with different numerical values. so the expression is false.
console.log(-4 == 4);//false

- 4 === 4
// In the case of "-4 === 4", the statement is false. The value of -4 is not equal to 4, and their types are also different (one is a negative integer, and the other is a positive integer). So, the strict equality comparison returns false..
console.log(-4 === 4);//false


- 4 != 4
// The statement "-4 != 4" is true. The "!=" operator checks for inequality, and it returns true when the two values being compared are not equal. In this case, -4 is not equal to 4, so the statement is true..
console.log(-4 != 4);//true


- 4 !== 4
// The statement "4 !== 4" is false. The "!=="" operator is used for strict inequality comparison, which means it checks both the values and types of the operands. In this case, both operands are the number 4 and -4, and they have the diff value and type (both are numbers), so the strict inequality comparison returns true

console.log(-4 !== 4);//true


- 4 != '4'
// -4 is not equal to string '4', so the expression is true.
console.log(-4 != 4);//true

- 4 == '4'
// -4  and  4 are total different value, so the expression is false.
console.log(-4 == 4);//false


- 4 === '4'
// -4 and 4 are total different value and type are number(both) bez of strict inequality comparison, so the expression is false.
console.log(-4 === 4);//false
